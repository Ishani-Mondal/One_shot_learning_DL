Details about the source files:
1. Omniglot_Data : Contains the dataset of 50 alphabets divided into background and evaluation set
2. data_loader.py : This file loads the dataset from a specified path and creates batches for the purpose of training and one-shot testing
3. image_augmentor.py : Augments the images with various affine transformations
4. siamese.py: Actual model of the Convolutional Neural Network
5. main.py: Trains the model by loading the data into siamese network and performs the one-shot testing

Instructions to train and test the model:
python main.py
